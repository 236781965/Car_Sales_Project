# Car_Sales_Project


Background
The company operates as a car dealership offering a wide range of car models. To improve business insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making, the company identified the need for a dynamic Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI.

Objective
The primary goal of this project was to design and build a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to track and analyse Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to car sales. This dashboard empowers stakeholders to monitor trends, evaluate performance, and identify growth opportunities at a glance.

Problem Statement
KPI Tracking:

Provide real-time insights into critical metrics such as total sales, average sales price, and units sold.
Allow stakeholders to evaluate Year-to-Date (YTD), Month-to-Date (MTD), and Year-over-Year (YOY) metrics.
Compare current metrics with Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) for in-depth analysis.
Visualizations and Data Trends:

Enable trend analysis of weekly sales.
Provide geographical insights via map visualizations of regional performance.
Showcase key breakdowns by body style, colour, and dealer region.
Interactivity and Insights:

Enable users to filter data dynamically using slicers for body style, transmission type, dealer region, and engine type.
Highlight actionable insights for decision-making through KPI cards and trend graphs.
